# Projecte
Web Scraper 1.0 - implemented in Python 

Done:
1) Terminal menu and graph implemented
2) Calls to the servers implemented
3) Scraping of images, saving them in a directory with the name of the web implemented
4) Scraping text, in raw or layout format
5) Scraping of all html, filtering out scripts and other non-html text
6) Graph implementation only scraps when all paramaters are set


To do:
1) Implement option 4
1.2) Implement the option to choose the name of the directory where you're saving everything
2) Finish implementing the exclusive use of graphic menu or terminal menu (that things do not appear from one when the other is being used)
3) Add second layer for sub-options of scraping methods
4) Implement all options for dynamic websites.
